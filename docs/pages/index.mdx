# Yi -- Chain-abstracted Smart Account

:::info
Yi is in private alpha and the docs are a work-in-progress.  [Contact Derek](https://t.me/derek_chiang) if you have any questions.

Yi is a **chain-abstracted smart account** that you can embed into your application, to enable a seamless onboarding and transaction experience for your users.

Through **account abstraction** and **chain abstraction**, Yi removes the major pain points with Web3 UX today, including:

- Bridges
- Gas
- Seed phrases
- Confirmations

Read on to learn Yi's features, and [how Yi compares with other AA solutions](/sdk/yi-vs-others).

## Yi's top features

### Chain abstraction, not bridges

Yi is the first *chain-abstracted smart account* -- a smart account that aggregates its tokens into a "chain-abstracted balance (CAB)" that's simultaneously available on every chain.

For example, if you deposit 100 USDC to a Yi account on Base, then deposit 200 USDC to the account on Polygon, the account will now hold 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" that can be spent on any chain.

Amazingly, these chain-abstracted tokens can be spent *at the speed of the destination chain* -- just like a regular transaction.  This is unlike a traditional bridge where the user has to wait for confirmations on both the source chain and the destination chain.
