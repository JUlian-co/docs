Magic Account is a **chain-abstracted smart account** that you can embed into your application, to enable a seamless onboarding and transaction experience for your users.

Through **account abstraction** and **chain abstraction**, Magic Account removes the major pain points with Web3 UX today, including:

- Bridges
- Gas
- Seed phrases
- Confirmations

## Magic Account's top features

### Chain abstraction, not bridges

Magic Account is the first *chain-abstracted smart account* -- a smart account that aggregates its tokens into a "chain-abstracted balance (CAB)" that's simultaneously available on every chain.

For example, if you deposit 100 USDC to a Magic Account account on Base, then deposit 200 USDC to the account on Polygon, the account will now hold 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" that can be spent on any chain.

Amazingly, these chain-abstracted tokens can be spent *at the speed of the destination chain* -- just like a regular transaction.  This is unlike a traditional bridge where the user has to wait for confirmations on both the source chain and the destination chain.

### Paymasters, not gas

With Magic Account, you can sponsor gas for users, or just let them pay gas with their tokens on another chain.  Donâ€™t ever ask users to buy gas tokens for a new chain again.

### Passkeys and socials, not seed phrases

Make your app friendly for both Web3 natives and normies.  With Magic Account, your users can login with socials, passkeys, and EOAs.

### Permissions, not confirmations

Magic Account supports [ERC-7715 permissions](/sdk/knowledge-base/permissions), an open-standard for automating transactions for users to enable 1-click trading and even server-side automation.  No more annoying confirmation prompts to distract your users.
