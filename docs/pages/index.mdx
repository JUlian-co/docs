# ZeroDev -- Build with Smart Accounts

ZeroDev provides tooling and infra for developers to build dapps and wallets with smart accounts.

The first question you must answer before using ZeroDev is: are you building a wallet or a dapp?

## Are you building a wallet or a dapp?

The line between wallets and dapps can be blurry in Web3, especially as smart accounts make wallets more capable than ever before.

For the purpose of using ZeroDev, we define wallets and dapps as follows:

- DApps are applications where you'd rather your users bring their own wallets.

- Wallets are applications where you don't want your users to bring their wallets; rather, you want your app to be the wallet for them.

## Using ZeroDev for a DApp

If you are building a dapp, we recommend the following approach:

- Use Yi as your onboarding wallet, for users who don't have smart wallets.
- Use the capability API through Viem/Wagmi to communicate with the connected smart wallet, whether it's Yi or another smart wallet the user brings.
- Set up capability infra (e.g. paymasters) through the ZeroDev dashboard.

## Using ZeroDev as a Wallet

If you are building a wallet, we recommend the following approach:

- Use the ZeroDev SDK to set up an embedded smart account.
- Use the capabilities API to interact with the smart account.
  - Use the ZeroDev SDK to interact with the smart account when you need more advanced functionalities that the capabilities API doesn't provide.
