# Setting up the Yi Connector

The Yi Connector is a Wagmi connector with a customizable UI.  Through the UI, your users can create an embedded smart wallet, or connect with an existing smart wallet.  In either case, the resulting Wagmi connector will expose [a standardized API](/dapp/knowledge/capabilities) for your application to interact with, thus decoupling your application from the implementation details of the smart wallet.

## Import

```ts
import { yiConnector } from '@zerodev/yi'
```

## Usage

```ts
import { createConfig, http } from '@wagmi/core'
import { mainnet, sepolia } from '@wagmi/core/chains'
import { yiConnector } from '@yi/connector'

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [mainnet, sepolia],
  connectors: [yiConnector({
    // Yi connector parameters
  })],
  transports: {
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
    [sepolia.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

## Parameters

```ts
import { type YiConnectorParameters } from '@yi/connector'
```
