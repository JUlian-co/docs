# Chain Abstraction

One of the most powerful features of Yi is chain-abstracted balances (CAB).  When CAB is enabled for a user account for a particular token, say USDC, their USDC balances across all chains will be aggregated into one balance -- the chain-abstracted balance.  Then, the user can use the balance on any chain.  The best part?  A transaction using CAB is just as fast as a regular transaction -- the user doesn't need to deal with bridging at all.

There are a huge variety of use cases for CAB.  Some common examples are:

- Improve onboarding: instead of asking your user to deposit tokens on a specific chain, just let them deposit tokens on any chain.  That way, they don't have to bridge tokens.

- Improve multi-chain apps: if your app interacts with protocols on many chains,

- Chain-abstracted margin:

## Using CAB from Yi 

Using CAB from Yi is simple -- simply set the `cab` setting to a list of tokens you want to enable CAB for.

A 7710 session will then be created for the account.  The session will be able to do two things:

- Transfer tokens into a CAB vault.
- Make transactions for the account where it draws money from a liquidity provider before making the actual request.

## Using CAB

First, create a 7710 session with the 7710 session SDK:

```ts
const cabClient = await sdk.createCabClient({
  accountAddress: account.address,
  tokens: ['USDC'],
  // if `autoDeposit` is set to true, the user will sign two messages:
  // - one to enable the auto deposit
  // - one to create the cab session itsel
  autoDeposit: true,
  signMessage: (msg) => {
    // Here we have no idea what SDK the user is using, so we just ask
    // them to implement a signing function for us
    return account.signMessage(msg)
  },
})

// cabClient.sendUserOperation()...
```

When you enable CAB on Yi, all requests will be routed through the CAB client.

By default, the CAB client uses the master signer.  But if you also specify permissions, then it will use a session signer with the specified caveats.

Yi is a framework for building applications on top of chain-abstracted smart accounts (CASA).  With CASA,
