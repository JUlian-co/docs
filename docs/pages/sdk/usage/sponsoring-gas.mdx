# Sponsoring Gas

With Magic Account, you can sponsor gas for your users so they don't have to acquire gas tokens before using your app.

Note that if you are already using [chain abstraction](/sdk/usage/chain-abstraction), gas sponsorship may not be necessary because your users can already pay gas with their chain-abstracted balance.

There are two steps to sponsoring gas:

- Setting up a *paymaster* -- a smart contract that pays gas for your users's smart accounts.  Typically you use a third-party service for this.

- Send transactions using [the capabilities API](/sdk/knowledge-base/capabilities) with the paymaster.

## Set up a paymaster

For a paymaster to work with the capabilities API, it needs to be compliant with [ERC-7677](https://eip.tools/eip/7677) the paymaster standard.  These are the ERC-7677-compliant paymasters that we know of:

- [ZeroDev](/meta-infra/gas-policies)
- [Pimlico](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/paymaster)
- [Biconomy](https://docs.biconomy.io/Paymaster/7677/)
- [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform)

Sign up for one of these services and obtain a paymaster URL.

## Send transactions using `sendCalls` with the paymaster URL

### Wagmi

If you are using Wagmi, you can send sponsored transactions with [`sendCalls()`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSendCalls) or [`writeContracts()`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContracts), by including the following capabilities:

```tsx
capabilities: { 
  paymasterService: { 
    url: 'https://...',  // this is your paymaster URL
  } 
}
```

For example, using `sendCalls()`:

```tsx
import { useSendCalls } from 'wagmi/experimental'

function App() {
  const { sendCalls } = useSendCalls()

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        sendCalls({
          calls: [
            {
              data: '0xdeadbeef',
              to: '0xa5cc3c03994DB5b0d9A5eEdD10CabaB0813678AC',
            },
          ],
          capabilities: { 
            paymasterService: { 
              url: 'https://...'
            } 
          },
        })
      }
    >
      Send a sponsored transaction
    </button>
  )
}
```
