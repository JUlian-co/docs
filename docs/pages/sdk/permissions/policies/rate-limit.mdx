# Rate Limit Policy

The rate limit policy specifies the frequency at which the signer is allowed to send UserOps.

We have two types of rate limit policies:

- **Rate limits with no reset**: send one UserOp per `interval`, for up to `count` times.
- **Rate limits with reset**: send `count` UserOps within an `interval`, for an indefinite number of intervals.

## Rate limit with no reset

Send one UserOp per `interval`, for up to `count` times.  Each UserOp call must have at least an `interval` of time between it and the next call.

### API

```ts
import { toRateLimitPolicy } from "@zerodev/permissions/policies"

// In this example, the signer can send one UserOp per month
const rateLimitPolicy = toRateLimitPolicy({
  count: 1,
  interval: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,  // one month in seconds
})

const validator = toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
  signer: someSigner,
  policies: [
    rateLimitPolicy,
    // ...other policies
  ],
})
```

Arguments to `toRateLimitPolicy`:

- `count`: the number of intervals.
- (optional) `interval`: the length of an interval.
- (optional) `startAt`: the starting UNIX timestamp for when the rate limit should take effect.  Before that, the signer cannot send any UserOps.

## Rate limit with reset

Send `count` UserOps within an `interval`, for an indefinite number of intervals.

The Rate Limit Policy with reset allows you to define a recurring allowance of UserOps that refreshes after each interval period. This is useful for creating recurring permissions that automatically renew, such as monthly subscription payments or regular administrative actions.

### API

Unlike the standard Rate Limit Policy which counts down a total number of allowed operations, the reset version gives the signer a fresh allocation of operations after each interval passes.

```ts
import { toRateLimitPolicy, RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT } from "@zerodev/permissions/policies"

// In this example, the signer can send one UserOp per month
const rateLimitPolicy = toRateLimitPolicy({
  count: 1,
  interval: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,  // one month in seconds
})

// only difference from non-reset is using RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT for policyAddress
const validator = toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
  policyAddress : RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT,
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
  signer: someSigner,
  policies: [
    rateLimitPolicy,
    // ...other policies
  ],
})
```

## Examples

If you want to do a monthly payment for 2 years (no reset after two years), the parameters will be:

```
  count : 24,
  interval : 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 // 30 days for month
  startAt : <Current timestamp in UNIX timestamp format>
```

If you want to do a monthly payment indefinitely, the parameters will be:

```
  policyAddress : RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT,
  count : 1,
  interval : 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 // 30 days for month
  startAt : 0 or undefined
```

## Notes

- We are aware that the semantics of `count` and `interval` changes completely between the `no reset` version and the `reset` version and it's very confusing; this is technical debt we intend to clean up.
- The `reset` version technically violates ERC-4337 storage rules since it needs to access `block.timestamp`, so it won't work with all bundler, but it's known to work with [UltraRelay](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/core-api/sponsor-gas#ultrarelay) and Pimlico.
