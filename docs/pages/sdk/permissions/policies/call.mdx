# Call Policy

The call policy limits the target (either contract or EOA) that the UserOp can interact with.  If the target is a contract, then you can further specify the functions the UserOp can interact with, as well as putting constraints on the values of the function arguments.

## API

```ts
import { ParamCondition, toCallPolicy, CallPolicyVersion } from "@zerodev/permissions/policies"

const callPolicy = toCallPolicy({
  policyVersion: CallPolicyVersion.V0_0_4,
  permissions: [
    {
      // target address
      target: contractAddress,
      // Maximum value that can be transferred.  In this case we
      // set it to zero so that no value transfer is possible.
      valueLimit: BigInt(0),
      // Contract abi
      abi: contractABI,
      // Function name
      functionName: "mint",
      // An array of conditions, each corresponding to an argument for
      // the function.
      args: [
        {
          condition: ParamCondition.EQUAL,
          value: value,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})

const validator = toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
  signer: someSigner,
  policies: [
    callPolicy,
    // ...other policies
  ],
})
```

- `target`: the target contract to call or address to send ETH to.  If this is `zeroAddress`, then the target can be any contract as long as the ABI matches (or it can be any address if no ABI is specified).
- `valueLimit`: the maximum value. that can be transmitted.
- `abi`: the contract ABI
- `functionName`: the function name
- `selector`: if you have multiple functions with the same name, you can distinguish them with `selector`.  For example: `selector: toFunctionSelector("transfer(uint256, uint256)")`.
- `args`: an array of conditions, each corresponding to an argument, in the order that the arguments are laid out.  use `null` to skip an argument.
  - `operator`: this can be `EQUAL`, `GREATER_THAN`, `LESS_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `NOT_EQUAL`.
  - `value`: the value of the argument to use with the operator.  For instance, `operator = EQUAL` and `value = 2` would mean "the argument must be equal to 2".
- `operation`: whether this is a call or a delegatecall.  Defaults to call.
