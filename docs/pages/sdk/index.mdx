# Yi -- Chain-abstracted Smart Account

Yi is the first *chain-abstracted smart account* -- a smart account that aggregates its tokens into a "chain-abstracted balance (CAB)" that's simultaneously available on every chain.

For example, if you deposit 100 USDC to a Yi account on Base, then deposit 200 USDC to the account on Polygon, the account will now hold 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" that can be spent on any chain.

Amazingly, these chain-abstracted tokens can be spent *at the speed of the destination chain* -- just like a regular transaction.  This is unlike a traditional bridge where the user has to wait for confirmations on both the source chain and the destination chain.

Beyond chain abstraction, Yi also supports all popular smart account features, including:

- Signin with passkeys, socials, and EOAs
- Sponsoring gas or paying gas in ERC20 tokens
- Batching transactions
- 1-click trading
- Automating transactions for users from a backend

## Use cases for Yi

### Multi-chain applications

If your application interacts with multiple blockchains, you can embedded a Yi account inside your app.  Users can access this embedded account via socials, passkeys, and EOAs.

Users can then deposit tokens into this account from any chain.  The tokens then become aggregated into a single "chain-abstracted balance" that your users can spend on every chain, saving them from having to bridge tokens and manage liquidity on multiple chains.

### Wallets

If you are building a wallet, Yi will give you superpowers in the form of not just account abstraction but also chain abstraction.

### Simplifying onboarding

Even if you don't need chain abstraction, Yi is still the best smart account solution for developers.  Check out [Why Yi over other AA solutions](/).

### Chain-abstraction for existing smart accounts

If you are already using a smart account solution such as Safe, Biconomy, and Alchemy, you can still use Yi to enable chain-abstraction for them.  Check out these docs to get started.
