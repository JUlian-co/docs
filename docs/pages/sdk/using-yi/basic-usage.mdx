# Basic Usage of Yi

As described in [Setting up Yi](/sdk/setting-up-yi), Yi can be used either as a Wagmi connector or a EIP-1193 provider.  When using Yi as a EIP-1193 provider, we recommend that you wrap the provider with a Viem client, like this:

```ts
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
import { walletActionsEip5792 } from 'viem/experimental'
 
const client = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: custom(yiProvider)
}).extend(walletActionsEip5792()) 
```

Now you can use the `client` to execute transactions and do anything you'd normally do with a wallet.
