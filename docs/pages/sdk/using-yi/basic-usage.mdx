# Basic Usage of Yi

Yi is the [first smart account solution](/sdk/yi-vs-others) to make extensive use of open standards including [ERC-5792](/sdk/knowledge-base/capabilities) (aka "capabilities") and [ERC-7715](/sdk/knowledge-base/permissions) (aka "permissions").  As such, you can use Yi through standard libraries including Wagmi and Viem.

To start using Yi:

- If you had [set up Yi as a Wagmi connector](/sdk/setting-up-yi#using-yi-through-wagmi), you can use Yi through [standard Wagmi hooks](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks).

- If you had [set up Yi as a Viem wallet client](/sdk/setting-up-yi#using-yi-through-viem), you can use Yi through [standard Viem actions](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/introduction).

The standard Wagmi and Viem APIs will allow you to perform basic actions such as [sending transactions](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/send-transaction), [reading from contracts](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/read-from-contract), etc.
