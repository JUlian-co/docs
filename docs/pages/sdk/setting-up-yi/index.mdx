# Setting up Yi

There are two ways to use Yi:

- If you are building a Wagmi app, we recommend [using Yi as a Wagmi connector](#using-yi-as-a-wagmi-connector).

- If you are not using Wagmi, we recommend [using Yi as a EIP-1193 provider](#using-yi-as-a-eip-1193-provider).

## Using Yi as a Wagmi connector

```ts
```

## Using Yi as a EIP-1193 provider

```ts
const yiProvider =
```

Once you have created a Yi provider, you typically want to "wrap" it inside a Web3 library to more easily use it.  We recommend using Viem because it natively supports the [capabilities API](/sdk/knowledge-base/capabilities) which is helpful for using AA features such as gas sponsorship.  Here's how to wrap the Yi provider with Viem:

```ts
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
import { walletActionsEip5792 } from 'viem/experimental'
 
const client = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: custom(yiProvider)
}).extend(walletActionsEip5792()) 
```
