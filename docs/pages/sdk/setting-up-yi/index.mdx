# Setting up Yi

There are two ways to use Yi:

- If you are building a Wagmi app, we recommend [using Yi as a Wagmi connector](#using-yi-as-a-wagmi-connector).

- If you are not using Wagmi, we recommend [using Yi as a EIP-1193 provider](#using-yi-as-a-eip-1193-provider).

## Using Yi as a Wagmi connector
