# Signing into Yi with a EOA wallet

You can sign into a Yi smart account with a EOA wallet (e.g. MetaMask), in which case the EOA will serve as the "signer" of the Yi account.  This means that every time the Yi account signs a transaction or a message, the EOA wallet will sign it.  If you want to avoid having the EOA sign every transaction/message, you can [enable 1-click trading](/sdk/using-yi/one-click-trading).

As described in [the intro](/sdk/setting-up-yi), you can use Yi through either [Wagmi](#wagmi) or [Viem](#viem).

## Wagmi

Set up the Wagmi config with a Yi connector.  You can create a Yi connector by wrapping a [EOA connector](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/connectors).  For example, to let users sign into Yi with MetaMask:

```ts
import { WagmiProvider, createConfig, http } from "wagmi"
import { metaMask } from "wagmi/connectors"
import { arbitrum, optimism } from "wagmi/chains"
import { ReactNode } from "react"
import { wrapEOAConnector } from "@build-with-yi/wagmi" // [!code focus]

export default function Providers({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const config = createConfig({
    chains: [arbitrum, optimism],
    transports: {
      [arbitrum.id]: http(),
      [optimism.id]: http(),
    },
    connectors: [ // [!code focus]
      wrapEOAConnector(metaMask()),  // [!code focus]
    ], // [!code focus]
  })
  const queryClient = new QueryClient()

  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        {children}
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  )
}
```
