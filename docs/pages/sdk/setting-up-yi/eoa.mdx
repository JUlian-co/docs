# Signing into Yi with a EOA wallet

You can create a Yi smart account by using a EOA wallet (e.g. MetaMask) as its "signer" -- meaning that the EOA wallet will sign the transactions and messages for the Yi account.

## Wagmi connector

You can set up a Yi connector by wrapping a EOA connector.

```ts
```

## EIP-1193 provider

You can set up a Yi provider with a EOA signer.

```ts
```

Then you can wrap the provider into a Viem wallet client [like this](/sdk/setting-up-yi#using-yi-through-viem).
