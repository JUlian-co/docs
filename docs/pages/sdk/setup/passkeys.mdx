# Signing into Magic Account with Passkeys

Passkeys are cryptographic key pairs created on end-user devices. [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys) are two major industry players pushing for the passkeys standard, which means that passkeys are widely available on consumer devices such as:

- iPhones / iPads / Macbooks
- Android phones / tablets
- Chrome (on Windows / Mac / Android)

[See here for a full list of systems that support passkeys.](https://passkeys.dev/device-support/#matrix)

The biggest value-add of passkeys, in the context of Web3, is **saving users from manually managing and securing their private keys.** Instead of writing down 12-word seed phrases, your user can simply use a passkey-enabled device to manage their wallet, and trust that the hardware will safely store the passkey, and the hardware vendor (e.g. Apple/Google) will [securely backup the keys](#how-are-passkeys-sync-ed-and-recovered).

Make sure you check out [the official passkeys demo](https://webauthn.io/) if you are not familiar with how passkeys work.

## Wagmi

Set up the Wagmi config with a Magic Account connector:

```ts
import { WagmiProvider, createConfig, http } from "wagmi"
import { arbitrum, optimism } from "wagmi/chains"
import { ReactNode } from "react"
import { passkeyConnector } from "@magic-account/wagmi" // [!code focus]

export default function Providers({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const config = createConfig({
    chains: [arbitrum, optimism],
    transports: {
      [arbitrum.id]: http(),
      [optimism.id]: http(),
    },
    connectors: [ // [!code focus]
      passkeyConnector(), // [!code focus]
    ], // [!code focus]
  })
  const queryClient = new QueryClient()

  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        {children}
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  )
}
```

Now, you can create "Login" and "Register" buttons using our hooks:

```tsx
import { usePasskey } from "@magic-account/wagmi";

export function ConnectButton() {
  const { connectRegister, connectLogin } = usePasskey();

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => connectLogin("Passkey name")} >
        Login
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={() => connectRegister("Passkey name")} >
        Register
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
