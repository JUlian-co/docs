# Setting up Magic Account

Magic Account is the first smart account solution to build entirely on open standards including [ERC-5792](/sdk/knowledge-base/capabilities) (capabilities) and [ERC-7715](/sdk/knowledge-base/permissions) (permissions).  As such, you can use Magic Account through your favorite libraries such as Wagmi and Viem, without being locked-in with a vendor-specific SDK.

## Installation

If you want to use Magic Account through Wagmi:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @magic-account/wagmi
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @magic-account/wagmi
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @magic-account/wagmi
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @magic-account/wagmi
```

:::

If you want to use Magic Account through Viem:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @magic-account/viem
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @magic-account/viem
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @magic-account/viem
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @magic-account/viem
```
