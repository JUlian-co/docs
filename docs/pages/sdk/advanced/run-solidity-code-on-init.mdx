# Run code when creating an account

:::info
Impatient?  Check out [a complete example here](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/emit-event-when-creating-account/main.ts).

Sometimes, you might want to execute some custom code when you create an account.  One common use case is when you want to emit an event whenever a user creates an account.

Running custom code during initialization can be done via plugins.  Specifically you can follow this process:

- Write a custom validator that executes your custom code during initialization.
- Install the validator to your account during account initialization.

## Developing a custom validator

Kernel implements the [ERC-7579 interface](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579), so you can write a 7579 validator.

[Here's an example of a validator that simply emits an event](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel/blob/ab30532763de3cdbe05dab7821652f11cc0a01c7/src/validator/EmitIdentifierValidator.sol).  Note that [the `onInstall` function](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel/blob/ab30532763de3cdbe05dab7821652f11cc0a01c7/src/validator/EmitIdentifierValidator.sol#L12) accepts an initialization data, which you can use to run customized code per account.

Once you have developed the custom validator, deploy it using `CREATE2` so that it has the same address across all chains.

## Install the validator

Once you have deployed the validator, the easiest way to install it is like this:

```ts
const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
  },
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
  pluginMigrations: [ // [!code ++]
    { // [!code ++]
      // This is the deployed validator address // [!code ++]
      address: "0x43C757131417c5a245a99c4D5B7722ec20Cb0b31", // [!code ++]
      type: PLUGIN_TYPE.VALIDATOR, // [!code ++]
      // this is the data passed to `onInstall` // [!code ++]
      data: "0x",  // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
  ], // [!code ++]
})
```

Now, your validator's `onInstall` function will run whenever an account is created.
