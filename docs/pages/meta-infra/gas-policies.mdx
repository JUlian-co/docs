# Gas Policies

You can configure **gas policies** for ZeroDev paymaster to have fine-grained control over what you sponsor, and how much.

Paymaster policies can be configured through either [the dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/paymasters) or [the API](/meta-infra/api).

## Policy Types

There are four types of gas policies on ZeroDev:

- Project policies: policies that apply to the entire project. 
- Contract policies: policies that apply to specific contracts.
- Wallet policies: policies that apply to specific wallet addresses.
- [Custom policies](/meta-infra/custom-gas-policies): if none of the policies above meet your needs, you can program totally custom policies via a webhook.

## Rate Limit Types

When you create a new policy, you set up one or more *rate limits*.

There are four types of rate limits:

- Amount: limit by the amount of gas
- Request: limit by the number of requests
- Gas Price: limit by the current gas price
- Amount per txn: limit by the amount of gas per transaction

## Policy examples

The policies and rate limits are hopefully intuitive, but here are some common examples in case they are helpful.  We will be using Polygon (MATIC) in these examples.

### Sponsor up to 1 MATIC every hour for the entire project

Here we create a project policy:

</p>

### Sponsor 100 transactions per minute for a specific contract

Here we create a contract policy:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/gas_policy_example_2.png" width="80%" />
</p>

### Sponsor transactions for a specific function when gas price is below 50 GWEI

Here we create a contract policy:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/gas_policy_example_3.png" width="80%" />
</p>

### Sponsor 100 transactions per hour for a specific address

Here we create a wallet policy:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/gas_policy_example_4.png" width="80%" />
</p>
