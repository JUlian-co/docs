# Meta AA Infrastructure

ZeroDev works with major AA infra providers to provide a "meta intrastructure."  Our meta infra proxies traffic to the underlying bundlers and paymasters, ensuring that our users have the highest possible uptime, since traffic can be routed to a different bundler when one goes down.

ZeroDev integrates with the following infra provider (in alphabetical order):

- Alchemy
- Gelato
- Pimlico
- StackUp

To get started using bundlers & paymasters through ZeroDev:

## Getting a project ID

"Project IDs" are API keys for accessing ZeroDev infra.  Sign up for project IDs at the [ZeroDev dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/).

## Setting up sponsoring policies

If you would like to sponsor gas for your users, you need to set up gas policies on the dashboard.

[Learn more about gas policies here.](/meta-infra/gas-policies)

## Using RPCs

Now you can use your project IDs to connect to bundlers and paymasters.  The following RPCs can be used with [ZeroDev](/) or any AA SDKs.

- Bundler RPC: `https://rpc.zerodev.app/api/v2/bundler/<PROJECT_ID>`

- Paymaster RPC: `https://rpc.zerodev.app/api/v2/paymaster/<PROJECT_ID>`
