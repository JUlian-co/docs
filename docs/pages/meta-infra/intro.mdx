# Meta AA Infrastructure

ZeroDev works with major AA infra providers to provide a "meta intrastructure."  Our meta infra proxies traffic to the underlying bundlers and paymasters, ensuring that our users have the highest possible uptime, since traffic can be routed to a different bundler when one goes down.

ZeroDev integrates with the following infra provider:

- [UltraRelay](/sdk/core-api/sponsor-gas#ultrarelay), ZeroDev's own bundler optimized for sponsored transactions
- Alchemy
- Gelato
- Pimlico

To get started using bundlers & paymasters through ZeroDev:

## Getting a ZeroDev RPC

You will need an RPC to start using bundlers & paymasters through ZeroDev.

- Sign up at the ZeroDev dashboard
- Create a project
- Copy the RPC from the project page (each network has an RPC).

The same RPC can be used as both bundler and paymaster RPCs.

[Learn more about bundler & paymaster RPCs here](/meta-infra/rpcs).

## Setting up sponsoring policies

If you would like to sponsor gas for your users, you need to set up gas policies on the dashboard.
